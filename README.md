Website for our waste classification!

In the folder jupyter_notebooks/ you'll find the code we used for creating our models...

To run docker:

1. Open path of project in cmd

2. docker build --tag <container-name> .
!Important: Add . at the end of the line!

3. docker images
-> View your images

4. docker run -d -p 5000:5000 <container-name>
-> After successfully build you can open localhost/5000 to use the website

Extra: docker ps
-> Use for see all running docker images atm

Extra: docker stop <container-name>

Extra: docker container prune
-> Stop all unused resources, freeing up space



!!!IMPORTANT!!!
If you want to use the feature to upload images to Google Drive via website:

1. Create client_secrets.json in the same path where app.py is located

2. In client_secrets.json write:
{"access_token": "<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>", "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>", "refresh_token": "<YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>", "token_expiry": "<YOUR...>", "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token", "user_agent": null, "revoke_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke", "id_token": null, "id_token_jwt": null, "token_response": {"access_token": "<YOUR...>", "expires_in": 3599, "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive", "token_type": "Bearer"}, "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"], "token_info_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo", "invalid": false, "_class": "OAuth2Credentials", "_module": "oauth2client.client"}

---> You have to create this via the Google Cloud API!

3. Enable the bool variable "upload_to_google_drive" in app.py to true (line 23). Default is false!

4. If you added the json file, you can start the flask app via docker or console

5. If you are trying to upload an image, you should be able to authorize yourself

6. When you authorized yourself, a new file will be created automaticly (mycreds.txt)

7. Your done! Now it should be possible to upload files in your folder via website!

--> If you have problems, maybe you forgot to edit the id for the folder in app.py. It's a variable below imports named id_folder (line 22). Right now thats mine, so you have to edit it. You'll find your folder id in your Google Drive.Just do a right click on the folder.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you do not want to use this feature, then you do not need to create the file. However, you must then make a change in the code app.py! In line 23 you have to set the bool False!
Now no more images are uploaded, so the first function doesn't work anymore. The function to classify a picture now works correctly, but the photo is not uploaded anymore!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
